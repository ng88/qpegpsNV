        <p class="red"><b>Installation</b></p>
        <p>Just install the provided qpegps package. </p>
        <p><i>Warning:</i> The format of the entries in maps.txt has changed since 
          version 0.2.3. The installlation of the 0.9 version will overwrite an 
          existing maps.txt ! For those who want to update their old maps.txt 
          manually: Just add width and height of the images behind the scale entry. 
          If You get problems at downloading maps, You may need to install the
          zlib package, too (this depends on Your installed Qtopia or Opie version).

        <p>qpeGPS uses wget for fetching maps from the net. If Your PDA is connected 
          via a proxy server to the internet, You may need to set the address 
          of the "Proxy" (e.g. http://foo.bar.com:80). If You don't 
          use a proxy server, just let it empty. (For the specialists: this sets 
          the environment variable http_proxy. If it is still set in Your environment, 
          let it empty). </p>
<p>
You can select the units for altitude, speed and
distance. The format of the position can be selected, too.
There are also checkboxes where You can select which information
will be displayed on the map.

        <a name="status" class="red"><b>2. GPS Status</b></a>
        <p>The setup and the health of the GPS connection is displayed on the
GPS status page.
</p>
<p>
In order to use all the features of <i>qpegps</i>, a proper connection to
a GPS device is needed. <i>qpegps</i> does not directly connect to the
device, it uses a separate program called "gpsd". <i>gpsd</i> is a daemon
program which runs in the background connects and reads data from
a GPS and provides its data via Tcp/Ip to clients via the telnet
protocol.<i>gpsd</i> needs to be run where the GPS is physically connected
to. <i>gpsd</i> is not part of <i>qpegps</i> but its included in the installation.
<i>gpsd</i> is freely available from the web (<a href="http://www.russnelson.com/gpsd">click here</a>
Thanks to Russ Nelson).</p>
<p>The GPS status page consists of four sections:</p>

        <span class="red"><b>2.1 gpsd Settings</b></span>
        <p>
Here you can change the arguments to <i>gpsd</i> when run locally (default).
Or specify the hostname/port of the remote machine <i>gpsd</i> is running on.
Note: in order to run <i>gpsd</i> on the local machine the hostname must be "localhost".
Any modifications to the setup here will automatically reset the current
connection and start/restart <i>gpsd</i> if necessary.
</p>

<p>
CompactFlash GPS users: try changing <i>gpsd</i> arguments to
<tt>-p /dev/ttyS3 -s 4800</tt> if you have no GPS signal.
</p>
        <p><a href="#top">back</a> </p>
        <p><span class="red"><b>2.2 Data Status</b></span></p>
        <p>This group provides a quick overview of the current health of the GPS
          connection. The data is updated every 1/4 second and reflects the actual
          data read from the GPS (via <i>gpsd</i>). </p>
        <p>
  <b>gpsd:</b> Shows the status of the vital <i>gpsd</i> connection.
  The status is either green (OK) which means a proper telnet connection
  to the <i>gpsd</i> program has been established and data can be exchanged.
  Or the status is red (???) which means <u>no</u> connection has been established.
  </p>
  <p>Please check <i>gpsd</i> settings.</p>


  <b>GPS:</b> Shows the actual status of the GPS device connected to <i>gpsd</i>.
  A valid <i>gpsd</i> connection is required to show any useful information.
  The status is either green which means a GPS device has been found and is
  sending data correctly. In this case the status also shows the three letter
  GPS device code (e.g. GRM form Garmin). Or the status is red (???) which means <u>no</u> GPS device was found or the GPS stopped sending.
  <p>Please check the cable or <i>gpsd</i> settings.(e.g. baud rate) </p>
  <p><u>Note:</u> It is possible that the status shows multiple device tags alternating.
  This is not a problem, it just shows that there is more than one GPS device
connected.
  (e.g. a GPS and a DGPS device).</p>

  <b>GMT:</b> This field either shows the current GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) received by
  the GPS (green) or "No GMT Signal rcvd" (in red) when no valid GPS connection has
been found yet.
  Or it shows the last received time in red meaning the GPS has stopped sending
data.
  <p>
  <b>Lat/Lon:</b> These fields show the last fixed position (Latitude/Longitude) of the
GPS
  in either green which means the shown location is valid for the GMT time shown
above, or in
  red, which means the shown position is outdated/not valid since the GPS can not
achieve a
  proper location fix due to various problems.
  </p>
  <p><u>Note:</u> A proper connection to the GPS is required at all times to display a valid
fix.
  If the connection to the GPS is interrupted somehow the status will turn red to
reflect this
  accordingly. However, for your convinience the position of the last valid fix and
it's
  time stamp are still shown.</p>
        <p><a href="#top">back</a> </p>
        <p><span class="red"><b>2.3 Misc Graphics</b></span></p>
        <p>This group shows various information. Three timegraphs at the top show
          the changes to the Altitude (A), the Speed (S) and the Satellites (#)
          over the past 160 seconds. The altitude and speed timeline shows <u>relative</u>
          values. All values shown are scaled so the maximum and minimum values
          known so far line up with the upper and lower margins of the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
The Satellite timeline shows valuable information about the number of Satellites
visible (blue)
and number of Satelites used for the position pix (green) at that time. Since only
twelve Satellites can be used at any time the graph shows absolute values (12
pixels). In addition,
if there is a communication problem with the GPS, a red vertical
bar is shown.
</p>
<p>
Below the timelines is a compass showing the current heading and bearing with
arrows in the color
chosen in the qpegps main setup. On the right hand side of the compass it shows the
current speed, altitude,
heading and bearing in absolute values and in the format chosen in the qpegps main
setup.
</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> The display of Heading and Bearing can be switched on/off independantly
(see main setup).</p>

        <p><span class="red"><b>2.4 Satellite Signal Quality</b></span></p>
        <p>This graph shows the SNR (Signal Noise Ratio) from 0db to 50db for
          each satellite in view, which basically expresses the quality of the
          signal for each satellite and the location fix in total. In addition
          the name of each Satellite is shown below the graph. If there is a current
          valid location fix the signal bars are drawn in green, otherwise they
          are drawn in red. </p>

        <p>
The map download feature allows you to download maps for use with qpegps from
the internet.  There are several sites which provide free maps for download.
<br>
</P><p>There are two download modes in qpegps. Press download button and you will see popup menu where you can chose between this two modes. Chose <B>"Download few maps cover area from expedia" or "Download few maps cover area from multimap"</B> menu item in this popup menu if you want to <B>download few (many) map files
which will cover some area (region)</B> from www.expedia.com or www.multimap.com (read 3.3.1. item for more info about this mode). or chose <B>"Download single map from configurable source"</B> if you need to download single map file from any configurable source (not www.expedia.com or www.multimap.com) (read 3.3.2. item for more info about this mode).
</P>
<P>
   <B>3.3.1. Area download mode.</B><br> In this mode you can download few maps which will cover some area, but this feature now available only for some sources (www.expedia.com or www.multimap.com). <br>If you will chose "Download few maps cover area from expedia" or "Download few maps cover area from multimap" menu item you will see "Download maps" dialog. There are two available forms of this dialog:
</P>
<P>
  - In first (default) form (<B>"Area size"</B> form) you must enter area central point coordinates. You can do this by two ways: by entering coordinates (in degrees in "Lat.(D.d):" / "Long.(D.d):" fields) or by choosing waypoint (place) coordinates (press "Select central point" button). This is useful if you need to download maps around some point (for example your current coordinates). Also you need to enter vertical (North-South) and horizontal (East-West) area distances from the central point (half of total area size) which must be covered by maps. All this distances in kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   For example if you want to download maps which will cover area 300 x 300 km around the center of the Moscow (Russia) you must to enter coordinates Lat.(D.d): 55.7516 Long.(D.d): 37.6177 (or press "Select central point" button and chose Moscow place (waypoint) from appropriate dialog) and enter 150 in the "North-South area size:" and  "East-West area size:" fields.
</P>
<P>
   - In alternative form (<B>"Start-End coordinates" form</B>) you can enter (or chose from places dialog) left-top point coordinates (in Start Latitude and Start Longitude fields in degrees) and right-button point coordinates (in End Latitude and End Longitude fields in degrees) .
</P>
<P>
  You can switch between this modes by pressing "Area size" or "Start-End coordinates" items in the appropriate horizontal switchbox.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>  In both forms you can chose map Scale in appropriate listbox (for example use 100 000 or 200 000 scale to intercity road navigation and 4 000 scale for navigation in to the city). Note: not all scales available from map server.
</P>
<P>Also you can select map file resolution use 1332x1332 for slow computers with small amount of the RAM (such as Sharp Zaurus 5x00) or high resolution for powerful computers (Sharp Zaurus SL-C750/760/860..). Higher resolution will usually produce less files and spend less disk space for the same area, but it will require more RAM and processor power while qpegps operation.
</P>
<P>  Also you can chose "Download directory" to chose directory and parse additional parameters to download utility(downmap) by filling "Params:" field. Open terminal (console) application and enter "downmap -h" command line to see full lits of the the parameters.
</P>
<P>
  If need to use proxy: open terminal (console) application and enter two commands:
export http_proxy=http://myproxy:8080
qpegps
<br>
where : myproxy - is a your proxy address and 8080 is a proxy port number.
 </P>
<P>
<b>3.3.2. Single map file download mode.</b><br>

In the Map Source groupbox, select the source from the dropdown for the site you wish
to download from.  In the Download groupbox, specify a name for the map.  The name
should not contain spaces and is not a filename.  Specify latitude and longitude as
decimal values being sure to set the hemisphere dropdowns to the appropriate
settings.  (Note that a longitude of -71.0 East is equivalent to the longitude of
71.0 West.)  Finally, specify the scale of the map you wish to download.  Some common
scale values are provided in the dropdown, but the field is also editable so you may
enter the exact scale that you want.  Clicking OK from this dialog will begin the
download.  Depending on the speed of your internet connection and the size of the map
image being downloaded, this could take a few minutes.  Once the download is complete
the map is available to qpegps.

</p><h4>Map Source Configuration</h4>

Qpegps uses a text configuration file to store map download source specifications.
In your qpegps maps directory there is a sources.txt file.  You can edit this file to
add additional map sources.  Qpegps comes preconfigured with one download source
setup (MapBlast).  Look at sources.txt to see the format.
